                    <p> This application has many other features and additions that could be added to enhance the functionality and usability for users. 
                        Many of the features that were accomplished help to support the proof of concept that will ultimately display the big picture idea. 
                        Some of those features that were not finished include, a user account settings page, a page displaying the users sleeping results. 
                        A way to compile and compare each user's data to be used when suggesting times that work best for our application when trying to fall asleep. 
                        Another enhancement includes focusing on design and layout of pages within the app and how they are navigated. 
                        All of these features could be added and deployed after the initial design is released to the Android market.</p>
