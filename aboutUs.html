                        Welcome to Soothing Slumber, a website specially created to aid in the control over your sleep. 
                        We wanted to create a way for all ranges of people from high school students to working adults to take back control over their sleep. 
                        We know it can be difficult to put your phone down and get some sleep. Phones give us a rush of dopamine; 
                        it is the chemical released in our brain that makes us feel good. So, no wonder it is so hard 
                        at the end of our long day to want to put it down. Soothing Slumber has just what you need to break the cycle of scrolling through videos mindlessly, 
                        we created an application that stops you from this cycle by having your phone sleep for periods of time to snap you out of craving more interactions with your phone.  </p><br>
